# Model Predictive Control (MPC) Simulation Project

## Overview

This project showcases the implementation of Model Predictive Control (MPC), an advanced control algorithm that optimizes system behavior by predicting future states and adjusting control inputs accordingly. The simulations include theoretical models and practical applications such as real-time drone control.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic System Simulations**: Implements both theoretical state-space models and practical, interactive drone flight control.
- **Visualization Tools**: Utilizes Matplotlib and Pygame for visual feedback on control strategies, enhancing user interaction and understanding.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** and **NumPy**: Used for computational tasks and matrix operations essential for control algorithms.
- **Matplotlib** and **Pygame**: Employed for visualizing simulation results and facilitating interactive simulations.

## Project Objectives

Demonstrate the effectiveness of MPC in precision management of dynamic systems, making it applicable to industries like robotics and aerospace where exact control is paramount.
